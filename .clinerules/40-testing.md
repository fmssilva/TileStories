## 1. Testing Strategy

Two separate questions need separate answers here, and conflating them is what makes AR
testing feel slower than it needs to be: **"how do I iterate on a feature quickly"** and
**"how do I know a piece of logic is actually correct."** §6.1 answers the first, §6.2
the second. Do both — they're not alternatives to each other.

### 1.1 The Development Loop — Iterate Fast, Spend Real-Device Time Only Where It's Needed

A full build-deploy-test cycle on a real device takes minutes; an Editor Play Mode
iteration takes seconds. Defaulting to the slow loop for everything is the single
biggest productivity loss in Unity AR development. Use the fastest tier that can
actually answer the question you're asking, and only escalate when it can't.

**Tier A — Mock localization in the Editor (this is where most iteration happens).**
Every wall-tracking implementation gets a `MockLocalizationProvider` (or equivalent)
alongside the real tracker, selected via `#if UNITY_EDITOR` or a settings flag, that
immediately fires a successful "localized" event with a fixed pose against a flat
reference plane in the scene — no camera, no Immersal call, no device. Add basic
keyboard fly-through controls to the scene camera so you can walk the virtual wall in
the Editor Game View. Build this *first*, before any other feature that depends on
localization being "done," because everything above the tracking layer (POI spawning,
LOD, content cards, circuits, the timeline) can then be built and tested entirely with
this mock, in seconds per iteration. Only drop out of this tier when the thing you're
actually testing is tracking-layer behavior itself.

**Tier B — Unity's XR Simulation (AR Foundation plumbing, still no device).**
Unity ships this as part of AR Foundation (`Project Settings -> XR Plugin Management ->
Simulation`) — no extra package needed. It simulates AR session lifecycle, device
orientation, and general AR Foundation plane/tracking behavior inside the Editor. It
does **not** simulate real VPS localization — that's what Tier A's mock is for. Use
Tier B specifically for AR-session-level plumbing questions Tier A's mock doesn't
touch (session lifecycle, orientation handling), not as a general substitute for Tier A.

**Tier C — Real device build (mocked or real tracking, depending on the question).**
Reserve this for things that genuinely can't be answered in the Editor: real screen
density and UI scaling, device-specific hardware behavior (Bluetooth audio,
permissions, storage), thermal/performance behavior over a real session length. If the
thing under test doesn't actually need a real wall, keep the mock tracker active even
on-device — that isolates "is this a device problem" from "is this a tracking problem."

**Tier D — Real wall, real Immersal, real device (field test).**
The one tier that can't be simulated or automated: actual localization against a
physical wall, real camera feed quality, real tracking stability as a visitor moves.
Requires a human physically present with the device. Use the human-in-the-loop
protocol in §7 for this tier specifically — don't invoke it for anything Tier A, B, or
C could have answered instead.

### 1.2 Automated Correctness Tests — What Actually Gets a Unit Test

Not every class needs a unit test, and writing one for everything is itself a form of
over-engineering for a project this size. Write a real, automated test for a class when
**both** of these are true:

- It's deterministic, pure logic — no `MonoBehaviour`, no scene, no device dependency,
  so it can be instantiated directly with `new` and asserted against.
- A silent bug in it would be expensive: it runs identically across every wall (so a
  bug affects all of them at once), or it drives a state machine with edge cases a
  quick manual pass would plausibly miss (entry points, race conditions, re-entrant
  triggers).

This is the actual filter — not "does this class have logic in it." Concretely, this
means config parsing and validation, the JSON-to-runtime-asset baking step, position/
coordinate resolution math, and any state machine governing multi-step user flows
(progression through a sequence, epoch/state switching, achievement or trigger
evaluation) all meet the bar. Something like a UI view's exact visual layout, or a
one-off wall-specific data quirk, usually doesn't — that's better caught by the dev
loop in §6.1 or an informal pass, not a maintained automated test.

Run these with Unity Test Framework in batch mode — this needs no human interaction at
all, the agent runs it and reads the results directly:
```
Unity.exe -batchmode -nographics -projectPath "<path>" -quit -logFile compile_log.txt
Unity.exe -batchmode -nographics -projectPath "<path>" -runTests ^
  -testPlatform EditMode -testResults editmode_results.xml -logFile editmode_log.txt
```
Check the compile log for `error CS` lines first — a compile error makes every test
result meaningless — then check the result XML for failures before considering a task
done. Use PlayMode batch tests the same way for the rare case where scene/prefab
wiring itself (not the logic behind it) needs verifying without a human.

When a test fails, stop and think before changing anything: is the test wrong (it's
asserting something that isn't actually the correct behavior), or is the logic wrong
(the code isn't doing what it should)? Write out up to three possible fixes, pick the
best one, apply it, and re-run.

## 2. Human-in-the-Loop Protocol (Tier C and Tier D only)

Tier A, Tier B, and §6.2's automated tests need no human interaction at all — run them
yourself and read the results. Only use this protocol for Tier C (real device build)
and Tier D (real wall/AR field test), since those are the only tiers that genuinely
require a human or physical access.

1. Add or update any single-line debug log statements needed to trace the specific thing
   being verified this round, and remove any stale trace logs left from the previous
   round.
2. Send a clear, specific message describing exactly what physical action is needed
   (e.g. "Ready — install and open the app, walk up to the wall, hold the phone steady
   for 5 seconds, then approve this command"), and wait.
3. Once the person confirms the action is done, read the device log file (from `adb
   logcat` redirected to a file, not piped directly to the terminal) and check for the
   expected trace lines and any errors.
4. If something is wrong, think through the big picture first — is this a tracking
   configuration issue, a data issue, or a code bug — write out up to three possible
   fixes, apply the best one, and repeat the loop. Do not move on until this round's
   specific check is clean.
