## From the POI Detail Card review (2026-09-27)

- Test renders live INSIDE `Assets/Screenshots/` (143 PNGs, 17 MB and growing ~150 per card tier). Unity imports
  every one as a texture (import time, `.meta` churn) and git tracks them all. Move every suite's evidence renders
  to a folder next to `Assets/` (like `TileStories/MarkerGalleryScreenshots/`), e.g. `TileStories/TestEvidence/<domain>/`,
  gitignore it, and keep only the few captures a doc links to. One shared helper for the output path.
- Flaky EditMode test seen twice across sessions: `TaxonomyRowIdentityTests` (`...ReportsBothRowsByPosition`,
  `...TypingADuplicateAndABlankCategoryLabel_...`), right after leaving Play Mode. Likely leftover window /
  undo state between tests; investigate in a taxonomy session. Same pattern seen 2026-09-27 on
  `KeywordListFieldTypingTests.TypingTwoKeywordsWithACommaBetween_GivesTwoKeywords` ("the click must focus the keyword
  field") in an EditMode run started right after a full PlayMode run; 1207/1207 on the immediate rerun. Suspect: Editor
  window focus still settling after Play Mode exits (real-click tests need a focused window).
- Commit hygiene: commit after every verified agent session (456 files were uncommitted after the card 6A session);
  keep `IPCE/` out of TileStories commits (separate repo or .gitignore).
- Search results rows show "category - level" (`PoiSubtitle`), so a hierarchy level name ("Hub", "Landmark")
  reaches visitors. Level names are authoring vocabulary. Decide in the Select/Filter/Search domain: category
  only, or a per-level "visitor label" field. (The card header gets its own fix in `_3.1` [6C].)


## From the POI Detail Card 6C + Tier 2 group A session (2026-09-27)

- `Editor.log` is 3.9 GB (`%LOCALAPPDATA%/Unity/Editor/Editor.log`): every compile check greps its tail and a search for an
  import error from an hour earlier needs the last 400 MB. Unity truncates it on restart; restart the Editor now and then, or
  add a small Editor-only "compile check" tool that reads only the lines after the last compile start.
- The test renders (`Assets/Screenshots/`) grew by about 60 files with Tier 2 (see the item above about moving them out of
  `Assets/`). Card galleries keep one render per entry; a picture-heavy tier makes that folder the slowest thing to import.
- A reusable Editor capture helper (open the window, scroll to a section, `ReadScreenPixel` cropped to the part of the window
  that is on screen) would save every UI session rebuilding it by hand in `execute_code`; keep it Editor-only, in `Editor/Dev/`.
- Flaky tests keep appearing "right after leaving Play Mode" (TaxonomyRowIdentityTests x2, KeywordListFieldTypingTests).
  Common suspect: STATIC state that survives between tests -- `SelectionEventBus` (static events + CurrentPoiId),
  `BlockRegistry.Shared`, `EditorNotice` queues. A small shared `[SetUp]/[TearDown]` reset (or a test base class)
  for every static bus would make these deterministic. One focused session, all domains.
- Interrupted agent sessions leave the tree broken: the card 7A session found the previous (interrupted) run had left
  code that did not compile and 22 red tests. Commit after every verified session so an interruption costs only
  the current session.
