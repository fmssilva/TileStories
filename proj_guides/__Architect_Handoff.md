# Architect hand-off -- the POI card's prototype rounds (`_3.3`)

Read this first in a new Architect chat, then `__AI_Architect.md`. It says where the work is and how a round runs.

## 1. Where the work is

- **The target is the Block Components Lab** (https://claude.ai/artifact/KDs2Ko1dYdBWYwZVhjvuEp), the record copy
  `_3.3.1_Prototype/Block Components Lab.html`, and its sources `_3.3.1_Prototype/lab_src/` (layers, build, self-test, captures;
  its README says how to change and prove it).
- **The spec is `_3.3_POI_Card_Styles.md`**: each part of the card and its Editor as the Lab shows it, with what Unity has today
  (Built / Partly / Not yet + the class). Section 17 lists the open items and the PROPOSED options.
- **The Lab holds every good option of Unity's card** (the audit of 2026-11-01: `lab_src/AUDIT_DECISIONS.md`, `lab_src/audit/`).
  The self-test passes with no bad value.
- **Next:** the developer improves the prototype step by step. First the PROPOSED options, one by one (keep or drop). Then the
  look and flow of each part. When a part is final, it becomes Worker blocks.
- **Unity:** CORE and FULL green at M3; no Worker block since. Sonnet subagents are rate-limited until 2026-11-05.

## 2. How a round runs

1. The developer looks at the Lab and writes corrections (with captures).
2. The Architect changes the Lab in a new layer (`lab_src/v8f.js`, then `v8g`…), runs the self-test, takes captures of what changed
   and looks at them (D1 contrast, D5 one focal action, the flow), then publishes to the same link and copies the record copy.
3. The same round, each decision goes into its part's section of `_3.3` as current state (no logs), with the Unity today line.
4. Commit and push (`git add -A -- . ':!IPCE'`).
- A large, independent piece (an audit across areas, a new view family) goes to subagents in parallel, each with a narrow brief
  and a report table. Subagents return text; the Architect saves the reports. Small changes the Architect makes itself.

## 3. Sessions and context

- One Architect chat per stretch of rounds. When a chat grows long (many captures, many rounds), the Architect updates this file
  and asks for a new chat; the new chat starts from this file, not from memory of the old one.
- Everything a new chat needs lives in the repo: the guide, the Lab sources, the audit, this file. Nothing lives only in a
  session's scratchpad.

## 4. Habits that keep earning their place

1. **Mutation proof.** "Break it, watch the named test go red, restore it."
2. **Look at the render.** Every block had a defect the green tests missed and a capture caught. For the Lab: the self-test proves an
   option reaches the phone; only a capture says it looks right.
3. **Measure before you change, and say the number** (the sheet's stops, contrast ratios).
4. **A differently shaped fixture finds what the big one cannot.**
5. **Audit against the code before a prototype counts as final** (`skills/Feature_Prototyping.md` step 5).
